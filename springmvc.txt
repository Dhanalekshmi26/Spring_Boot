**Spring MVC** means **Spring Model-View-Controller**.
It's a part of the Spring Framework used to build **web applications** (like websites).


### 🔧 What is it?

Spring MVC helps you build web applications by organizing your code into 3 parts:

1. **Model** – the data or business logic (like user details, products, etc.)
2. **View** – how things look (HTML, JSP – what user sees)
3. **Controller** – handles user requests (like when someone clicks a button)

---

### 📦 Simple Example:

Imagine you're building a **simple login page**.

* **User** opens the login page (View).
* They enter their username & password → click "Login".
* **Controller** gets that request and checks if the details are correct.
* If correct, it shows the welcome page (View again).
* **Model** might be used to store/retrieve the user info from a database.

---

### 💡 Think of it like:

> **Controller** is the waiter 🍽️ – takes your order (request), gives it to the kitchen (Model),
 and brings back the food (View).

### ✅ Why use Spring MVC?

* Organizes code neatly
* Easy to manage and test
* Connects frontend (View) and backend (Model) cleanly
* Works well with Spring Boot
