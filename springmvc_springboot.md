### ðŸŒ± **Spring MVC** (Before Spring Boot)

* You had to **do everything manually**:

  * Configure web.xml
  * Set up DispatcherServlet
  * Add dependencies by yourself
  * Handle server setup
  * Write a lot of boilerplate code

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem**: Too much setup! More coding, more XML, more configuration.

---

### ðŸš€ **Spring Boot** (Modern Spring MVC)

Spring Boot is like **an easier version of Spring MVC**.

* Built **on top of Spring MVC**
* **Auto-configures** everything
* Comes with **embedded server** (Tomcat/Jetty), no need to install separately
* You donâ€™t write XML â€” just use annotations
* Includes **production-ready features** (monitoring, logging, health checks)

### âœ… Why Spring Boot exists?

| Problem with Spring MVC | Spring Boot Solution                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual configuration    | Auto-configuration                                  |
| External server needed  | Built-in server                                     |
| Complex project setup   | Quick start with `spring-boot-starter` dependencies |
| No built-in tools       | Actuator, metrics, monitoring out of the box        |

---

### âš¡ In short:

> **Spring Boot = Spring MVC + Simplicity + Speed + Tools + Less Configuration**

---

### ðŸ§  Remember:

* Spring Boot **doesn't replace** Spring MVC â€” it **enhances** it.
* Spring MVC is still there **under the hood**.
* You write **Spring MVC controllers**, but Boot makes setup and running easy.
